# 📊 LegisModeler: Agent-Based Modeling of Legislative Bodies
LegisModeler is an agent-based model designed to simulate and analyze the inner workings of various legislative bodies (e.g., parliaments, congresses, councils). This project aims to explore the complex dynamics that arise within deliberative assemblies, focusing on how rules, incentives, and member behaviors influence decision-making processes and policy outcomes.

# 🚀 Project Overview
LegisModeler leverages agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the interactions of individual legislators within different types of legislative environments. The primary goal is to better understand the underlying dynamics of these bodies and how factors like voting rules, coalition building, party dynamics, and lobbying shape the outcomes of policy debates.

# Key Features
Customizable legislative environments: Simulate different types of legislative bodies (e.g., unicameral, bicameral).
Agent behavior modeling: Explore how varying incentives, ideologies, and negotiation strategies affect decision-making.
Flexible rule configurations: Adjust voting rules, quorum requirements, and committee structures to observe their impact.
Data visualization: Generate insights through plots and visualizations of simulation results.

# 📚 Background & Motivation
Legislative bodies play a critical role in shaping policies, yet they are often influenced by complex interpersonal dynamics and procedural rules. Traditional analytical models struggle to capture these nuances, which is where agent-based modeling can offer new insights. By simulating individual behaviors and their aggregate effects, we can gain a deeper understanding of how legislative systems function and identify conditions that lead to more effective decision-making.
